This project is about creating a simple article summarization tool in Python without using any heavy machine learning libraries like transformers. The aim is to take a long piece of text and produce a short summary by identifying the most important sentences based on word frequency. First, the input article is split into individual sentences, and then each sentence is broken down into words while removing common stopwords like “the”, “and”, or “is” that do not carry much meaning. A frequency table of the remaining words is created, and each sentence is scored based on the sum of frequencies of its words, normalized by the sentence length. The top-scoring sentences are then selected and combined to form the final summary, ensuring that the original meaning of the text is preserved in a shorter form. This approach is called extractive summarization because it picks actual sentences from the original text instead of generating new ones. The program is written in pure Python, making it lightweight and easy to understand for beginners, without requiring complex model installations or large datasets. It can summarize articles, essays, or any long-form text directly from user input and can be extended to work with files or online content. Overall, this task demonstrates how basic Natural Language Processing concepts like tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency analysis can be applied to create a functional summarization tool that helps reduce reading time and improve information accessibility.
